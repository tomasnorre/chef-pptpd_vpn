# TAG: option
#	Specifies the location of the PPP options file.
#	By default PPP looks in '/etc/ppp/options'
#
option /etc/ppp/pptpd-options

# TAG: logwtmp
#	Use wtmp(5) to record client connections and disconnections.
#
logwtmp

# TAG: localip
# TAG: remoteip
#	Specifies the local and remote IP address ranges.
#
#       Any addresses work as long as the local machine takes care of the
#       routing.  But if you want to use MS-Windows networking, you should
#       use IP addresses out of the LAN address space and use the proxyarp
#       option in the pppd options file, or run bcrelay.
#
#	You can specify single IP addresses seperated by commas or you can
#	specify ranges, or both. For example:
#
#		192.168.0.234,192.168.0.245-249,192.168.0.254
#
#	IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
#
#	1. No spaces are permitted between commas or within addresses.
#
#	2. If you give more IP addresses than MAX_CONNECTIONS, it will
#	   start at the beginning of the list and go until it gets
#	   MAX_CONNECTIONS IPs. Others will be ignored.
#
#	3. No shortcuts in ranges! ie. 234-8 does not mean 234 to 238,
#	   you must type 234-238 if you mean this.
#
#	4. If you give a single localIP, that's ok - all local IPs will
#	   be set to the given one. You MUST still give at least one remote
#	   IP for each simultaneous client.
#
# (Recommended)

localip <%= @local_ip %>
remoteip <%= @ip_begin %>-<%= @ip_end_block %>
